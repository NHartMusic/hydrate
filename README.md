# Hydrate

## A mobile app that reminds you to stay hydrated.

### How to Use

* Change the settings at any time by opening the application and clicking on the settings icon.

### Technology: a Simple MERN Stack

* Frontend
  * React Native
* Backend
  * Simple MongoDB configuration that stores how often users drink ( this is to track data, not to actually carry out frontend notifications; individual user preferences are stored on the user's device), hosted on mLab.
  * Express API with simple routes, hosted on Heroku.
  * Node.JS runtime environment
